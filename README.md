# rEVitalyze: The GlycoQuest Game

A Python Pygame-based educational game simulating the journey of engineered probiotic EVs delivering PMM2 to treat congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs).

## How to Run

1. Ensure Python 3 and Pygame are installed: ```
  pip3 install pygame ```
2. Run the game: ```
   python3 game.py ```
## Controls

- Click the glass to "drink" EV-fortified milk.
- Use arrow keys to dodge acid blobs and move enzyme.
- Drag EVs to receptors with mouse.
- Press 1 or 2 to enter mannose/glucose sequences.

## About

This game demonstrates key biological concepts from our iGEM synthetic biology project on PMM2-CDG treatment via engineered bacteria.
